# Releasing

Releases are available on [Sysl's GitHub releases page](https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl/releases) and on package registries (e.g. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/anzbank)).
&nbsp;
Sysl is using [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions) as continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) system.
&nbsp;

### Steps to publish new release

1. Any merged PR on master will trigger the [Generate-Tag workflow](https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl/blob/master/.github/workflows/generate-tag.yml). It will generate and push the respective version tag according to the commit message. We follow [Semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning.

2. The version tag push event then triggers the [Release workflow](https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml) to publish release to [Sysl's GitHub releases page](https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl/releases) (with changelog) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/anzbank/sysl).

   > Most of the release process is automated via [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/). GoReleaser creates and deploys `sysl-X.Y.Z-Os-Arch.tar.gz` and `sysl-X.Y.Z-Windows-Arch.zip` to the [Sysl Github Release page](https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl/releases). It also updates [sysl-homebrew](https://github.com/anz-bank/homebrew-sysl) with the latest release. See [GoReleaser config file](https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl/blob/master/.github/workflows/.goreleaser.yml) for further details.

   > The release workflow also pushes Sysl's Docker Images `anzbank/sysl:latest` and `anzbank/sysl:X.Y.Z` to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/anzbank/sysl).
